# Messaging-API

## How to run this API locally

This API can be run in any virtual environment that is using Python 3.7. I chose to use
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) to create a virtual 
environment by following the steps on 
[this page](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/set-up-virtual-environment-for-python-using-anaconda/). 
Once in the virtual environment, running 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
will install the dependencies needed to successfully run the API locally. Finally, 
`python app.py`
will start the API!
